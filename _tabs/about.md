# About Me👨‍💻

Hi!👋 I'm **Ridopandi Sinaga**.

Currently an  undergraduate IT student at the university of North Sumatra. I am interested in *Machine Learning* and *backend dev*. I *classify* large amounts of documents by *training models* to *automate repetitive tasks*. Additionally, I *optimize data pipelines* for excercise by *designing and building ETL pipelines* to ensure they run efficiently. I *explore and analyze data* and randomly *scrape data* from the internet. I spend a lot of my time *researching new technologies* that can *help me* reduce manual labor.
